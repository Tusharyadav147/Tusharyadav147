## ‚ö°Ô∏è About Me

I'm passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems. Over the past year, I've honed my skills in Python development and have gained valuable experience in AWS Services, PySpark, Airflow, and more. I'm eager to tackle new challenges and continue expanding my knowledge in the field of software development.

## üåü Roles and Responsibilities

- Currently working on a Data Engineering Project using cloud platforms such as AWS (EMR, AWS Glue, Athena, CodeCommit, S3, EC2) with PySpark to create ETL pipelines and Airflow to schedule ETL jobs.
- Designed, developed, and maintained end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines using AWS services, Airflow, and Matillion to ensure efficient and reliable data processing and integration.
- Utilized PySpark as the primary programming language to implement data transformations, data quality checks, and other data manipulation tasks, optimizing pipeline performance.
- Played a key role in establishing and maintaining data lineage documentation using Alation, enabling clear visibility into data flow and transformations for compliance and auditing purposes.
- Actively participated in Agile development methodologies by utilizing Atlassian suite tools such as Jira for issue tracking and Confluence for documentation, ensuring efficient project management and communication.
- Optimized AWS resources usage by implementing cost-effective solutions, such as resource scaling, spot instances, and utilizing serverless architectures, resulting in reduced operational costs.
